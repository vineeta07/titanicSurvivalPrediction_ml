# titanicSurvivalPrediction_ml
The Titanic dataset is a classic benchmark for demonstrating data preprocessing and classification modeling techniques in machine learning. This project aims to predict passenger survival on the RMS Titanic based on diverse features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and family relations. The dataset presents real-world challenges including missing data, categorical variables, and imbalanced classes, making it ideal to showcase skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, imputation, and model training. Through exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, and applying machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Logistic Regression, this project provides insights into the factors influencing survival while building a predictive model to estimate individual survival probabilities.
